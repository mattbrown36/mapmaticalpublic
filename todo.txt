Immediate:
-Port all logged in .net mvc html to frontend app html.
-Recreate nav bar after login.
-Allow nav bar to be hidden.
-During debug, allow all actions to be used from other websites.
-Create view of worlds you're allowed to join.
-Start up multiverse when world selected.
-Multiverse grabs redis file for google cloud storage.
-Get frontend app going which connects to the multiverse container.




Eventually:
-Spruce up the front page.

Redis bucket data:
User redis data is contained in a folder named userid-<RandomGuid>. The name of this folder is stored in the SQL database.
-Every 5 minutes redis data should be pushed to the backup files current-1 and current-2.
We do it twice in case a transaction to one of them fails.
Before and after we write any of the files, we write a random value to <filename>-start and <filename>-end.
If the values in these files don't match, then we know that there was a write failure, and that we should try the other file.
After we write to the current files, we get a list of all files in the bucket.
We should see something like:
hour-next-<DATE>
hour-<DATE>
week-next-<DATE>
week-<DATE>
month-next-<DATE>
month-<DATE>

When we write to current, if hour-next doesn't exist, then we duplicate current as hour-next.
If hour-next is at least an hour old, we delete the existing hour and rename it to hour.
At that time, if week-next doesn't exist, we also copy it to week-next, and move down the
line in this fashion.
