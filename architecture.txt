mlDataService:
We have a single relational database for holding centralized information. We access this
database through entity framework. To allow our other services to access the database without
worrying about whether they have the correct schema, we funnel all other access through an
http api on the data server. The mlDataService consists of this API and the operations surrounding
accessing the relational database.

Additionally, as this is the only component in the system which is singular, we also cache
configuration information and secrets on this server. As a result, all other services
need only know the location of the mdDataService, and with that can grab all other
configuration information that they need to know.

For this reason, the server which mlDataService runs on must be locked down and only allowed to
communicate within the local subnet.
